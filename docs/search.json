Pedestrian traffic and reported casualties\nIn 2024, 1 cyclist were killed in West of England combined authority, whilst 55 were reported to be seriously injured and 266 slightly injured.\nTable 1 and Chart 1 show that cyclist traffic (measured by distance cycled) has increased between 2004 and 2024 whilst fatalities, serious and slight injuries have fallen.\nBetween 2023 and 2024, cyclist fatalities increased by % while cyclist traffic (distance cycled) increased by 173%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Number of reported pedestrian casualties by severity and traffic (pedestrian billion miles walked), GB: 2004 to 2024\n\n\nYear\nKilled\nSerious\nSlight\nAll\nTraffic\n\n\n\n\n2004\n2\n63\n276\n341\n73.06\n\n\n2005\n1\n55\n275\n331\n58.12\n\n\n2006\n3\n52\n300\n355\n39.63\n\n\n2007\n0\n64\n333\n397\n99.09\n\n\n2008\n2\n51\n276\n329\n119.61\n\n\n2009\n3\n61\n327\n391\n51.39\n\n\n2010\n2\n78\n345\n425\n79.42\n\n\n2011\n0\n78\n311\n389\n99.63\n\n\n2012\n1\n64\n328\n393\n87.21\n\n\n2013\n5\n60\n313\n378\n61.35\n\n\n2014\n1\n72\n362\n435\n60.82\n\n\n2015\n1\n69\n293\n363\n96.91\n\n\n2016\n1\n58\n323\n382\n87.96\n\n\n2017\n2\n42\n273\n317\n82.11\n\n\n2018\n0\n64\n345\n409\n84.91\n\n\n2019\n0\n52\n395\n447\n72.68\n\n\n2020\n0\n35\n227\n262\n109.11\n\n\n2021\n3\n52\n272\n327\n56.46\n\n\n2022\n1\n55\n259\n315\n67.05\n\n\n2023\n0\n53\n227\n280\n46.16\n\n\n2024\n1\n55\n266\n322\n126.18\n\n\n\nSource: DfT STATS19, National Travel Survey and Office for National Statistics population data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How far do Cyclists travel?\nThe National Travel Survey (NTS) which provides the number of trips and average distance travelled (NTS0303_ca) by person per year for Combined Authority residents. This is used to derive casualty rates per mile traveled for cyclist, which also use the landsat global 1km population data to estimate the population of the Combined Authority.\n\n\n4. Casualty rates per mile travelled\nThe cyclist casualty rate has increased for all severities in 2024 compared to 2004.\nThe overall casualty rate decreased by 45%. The fatality rate decreased by 70% compared to a 50% reduction for serious injuries and a 44% reduction for slight injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Casualty rates of cyclist casualties by severity per million miles cycled West of England CA: 2004 to 2024\n\n\nYear\nKilled\nSerious\nSlight\nAll\n\n\n\n\n2004\n0.027\n0.867\n3.774\n4.668\n\n\n2005\n0.017\n0.939\n4.739\n5.695\n\n\n2006\n0.076\n1.310\n7.571\n8.957\n\n\n2007\n0.000\n0.648\n3.358\n4.006\n\n\n2008\n0.017\n0.430\n2.304\n2.751\n\n\n2009\n0.058\n1.190\n6.360\n7.609\n\n\n2010\n0.025\n0.978\n4.348\n5.351\n\n\n2011\n0.000\n0.785\n3.119\n3.904\n\n\n2012\n0.011\n0.733\n3.762\n4.506\n\n\n2013\n0.081\n0.984\n5.095\n6.161\n\n\n2014\n0.016\n1.191\n5.945\n7.152\n\n\n2015\n0.010\n0.713\n3.022\n3.746\n\n\n2016\n0.011\n0.660\n3.671\n4.343\n\n\n2017\n0.024\n0.512\n3.324\n3.861\n\n\n2018\n0.000\n0.752\n4.064\n4.817\n\n\n2019\n0.000\n0.715\n5.436\n6.151\n\n\n2020\n0.000\n0.319\n2.082\n2.401\n\n\n2021\n0.053\n0.923\n4.815\n5.791\n\n\n2022\n0.015\n0.818\n3.865\n4.698\n\n\n2023\n0.000\n1.147\n4.919\n6.066\n\n\n2024\n0.008\n0.433\n2.111\n2.552\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Sex and age comparisons\nBetween 2020 and 2024, 78% of cyclist casualties were male and 22% female.\nThere are 3.5 times more male than female cyclist casualties overall. This compares to NA more for 30-39, NA more for 0-11and NA more for 70+ - the only age group in which female casualties outnumber males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Which vehicles are involved in collisions with pedestrians?\nBetween 2020 and 2024, most cyclist fatalities occurred in 2 vehicle collisions involving a pedal cycle (2).\nHowever, the highest proportion of casualties from single vehicle collisions involve 1 pedal cycle (5.3%). The second highest proportion (0.3%) occurred in collisions when 2 vehicles involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Cyclist casualties in reported road collisions by severity showing other vehicles involved West of England CA: 2020 to 2024\n\n\nVehicles\nFatalities\nSerious injuries\nSlight injuries\nAll casualties\n% Fatalities\n\n\n\n\n1 pedal cycle\n1\n8\n10\n19\n5.3\n\n\n2 vehicles involved\n4\n232\n1210\n1446\n0.3\n\n\n3 or more other vehicles involved\n0\n9\n32\n41\n0.0\n\n\nTotal\n5\n249\n1252\n1506\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Time of day of collisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weekday peak time for cyclist KSIs is from 3pm to 8am. By contrast, the peak is from 1am to 7pm at weekends.\n\n\n8. What type of road?\nChart 5 shows that between 2020 and 2024, 80% of cyclist fatalities occurred on urban roads compared to 90% of all cyclist casualties. % of cyclist fatalities occurred on motorways. This would be people outside their vehicles whether they are moving at the time or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this report, urban roads are defined as those within an area of population of 10,000 or more in England and Wales or more than 3,000 in Scotland - roads outside of these areas are classified as rural https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/road-length-statistics-information/road-lengths-in-great-britain-statistics-notes-and-definitions.\n\n\n9. Vehicle movement on the road\nA majority of cyclist fatalities( 40 %) occur not at junction or within 20 metres compared to 45 % of serious injuries (adjusted). However, 60 % of fatalities occur at a junction compared to 50 % of serious injuries (adjusted).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Percentage of cyclist KSI casualties by severity and junction detail where the collision occurred, West of England CA: 2020 to 2024\n\n\nJunction\nFatalities\nSerious\nSlight\nAll casualties\n\n\n\n\nNot at junction or within 20 metres\n40%\n45.1%\n44%\n44.2%\n\n\nT or staggered junction\n40%\n41%\n43%\n42.7%\n\n\nCrossroads\n20%\n8.9%\n7.4%\n7.7%\n\n\nUsing private drive or entrance\n0%\n3.7%\n3.1%\n3.2%\n\n\n19\n0%\n1.1%\n2%\n1.9%\n\n\nJunction with more than four arms (not roundabout)\n0%\n0.2%\n0.4%\n0.3%\n\n\nData missing or out of range\n0%\n0%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections 10 not reproducible as data is not public\nSections 11 and 14 are explanatory text.\nThis document might also be useful for understanding the methodology behind the categories https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68373a464115cfe5bfaa2cd4/STATS20_2024_specification.pdf"
