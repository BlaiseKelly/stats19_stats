    "text": "These pages show the outputs of the functions/markdown scripts in stats19_stats, which build on the import functions in the stats19 R package.\nThe goal of this repository/website is to facilitate people to easily reproduce the DfTs statistical summaries for their local area and/or additional plots and insights to provide data for campaigns where road safety is significant.\nThe first page ‘DfT Pedestrian factsheet’ is a reproduction of the government pedestrian factsheet. It is possible to calculate these figures for any spatial area using the functions in the stats19 R package, along with mature and comprehensive R packages such as sf, stplanr and generate plots that can be executed by running a script with tmap and gpplot2. The modal data is only available from the ONS disaggregated by Combined Authority (CA). The two tabs “WECA Combined authority cyclist factsheet” and WECA Combined Authority pedestrian factsheet” is an example of this. The scripts for these sheets are available as qmd files in the repository and can be used to produce the charts and tables. Some have also been adapted into functions that are more flexible and can be applied to subsets of the data.\nOne of the main aims of these tools is to enable people at a local level to be able to confidently use the vast amount of data in the stats19 data to inform local policy. These are shown in the example for the local authority of Bristol and Manchester and the Parish Councils of Winsley and Lymington and Pennington.\nA summary of these functions is given below."
