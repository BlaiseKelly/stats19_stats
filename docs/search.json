    "text": "These pages show the outputs of the functions/markdown scripts in stats19_stats, which build on the import functions in the stats19 R package.\nThe goal of this repository/website is to facilitate people to easily reproduce the DfTs statistical summaries for their local area and/or additional plots and insights to provide data for campaigns where road safety is significant.\nThe first page ‘DfT Pedestrian factsheet’ is a reproduction of the government pedestrian factsheet. It is possible to calculate these figures for any spatial area using the functions in the stats19 R package, along with mature and comprehensive R packages such as sf, stplanr and generate plots that can be executed by running a script with tmap and gpplot2. The modal data is only available from the ONS disaggregated by Combined Authority (CA). The two tabs “WECA Combined authority cyclist factsheet” and WECA Combined Authority pedestrian factsheet” is an example of this. The scripts for these sheets are available as qmd files in the repository and can be used to produce the charts and tables. Some have also been adapted into functions that are more flexible and can be applied to subsets of the data.\nOne of the main aims of these tools is to enable people at a local level to be able to confidently use the vast amount of data in the stats19 data to inform local policy. These are shown in the example for the local authority of Bristol and Manchester and the Parish Councils of Winsley and Lymington and Pennington.\nA summary of these functions is given below."

Pedestrian traffic and reported casualties\nIn 2024, 409 pedestrians were killed in Great Britain, whilst 5823 were reported to be seriously injured and 12944 slightly injured.\nTable 1 and Chart 1 show that pedestrian traffic (measured by distance walked) has increased between 2004 and 2024 whilst fatalities, serious and slight injuries have fallen.\nBetween 2023 and 2024, pedestrian fatalities increased by 1% while pedestrian traffic (distance walked) increased by 3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Number of reported pedestrian casualties by severity and traffic (pedestrian billion miles walked), GB: 2004 to 2024\n\n\nYear\nKilled\nSerious\nSlight\nAll\nTraffic\n\n\n\n\n2004\n671\n9992\n24218\n34881\n12.89\n\n\n2005\n671\n9445\n23165\n33281\n12.64\n\n\n2006\n675\n9059\n21248\n30982\n13.01\n\n\n2007\n646\n8804\n20741\n30191\n12.35\n\n\n2008\n572\n8410\n19500\n28482\n12.45\n\n\n2009\n500\n7777\n18610\n26887\n12.93\n\n\n2010\n405\n7334\n18106\n25845\n12.13\n\n\n2011\n453\n7627\n18118\n26198\n12.49\n\n\n2012\n420\n7645\n17153\n25218\n12.13\n\n\n2013\n398\n6982\n16653\n24033\n12.54\n\n\n2014\n446\n7105\n17197\n24748\n12.25\n\n\n2015\n408\n6852\n16801\n24061\n12.51\n\n\n2016\n448\n6480\n16622\n23550\n13.00\n\n\n2017\n470\n6476\n16859\n23805\n13.59\n\n\n2018\n456\n6637\n15339\n22432\n13.90\n\n\n2019\n470\n6402\n14898\n21770\n13.63\n\n\n2020\n346\n4302\n10102\n14750\n14.66\n\n\n2021\n361\n4949\n11344\n16654\n14.08\n\n\n2022\n385\n5872\n13070\n19327\n14.95\n\n\n2023\n405\n6049\n12809\n19263\n15.41\n\n\n2024\n409\n5823\n12944\n19176\n15.92\n\n\n\nSource: DfT STATS19, National Travel Survey and Office for National Statistics population data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How far do pedestrians travel?\nThe National Travel Survey (NTS) which provides the number of trips and average distance travelled (NTS0303) by person per year for English residents. This is used to derive casualty rates per mile travelled for pedestrians, which also use the Great Britain population figure to estimate total distance walked each year.\n\n\n4. Casualty rates per mile travelled\nThe pedestrian casualty rate has fallen for all severities in 2024 compared to 2004.\nThe overall casualty rate decreased by 55%. The fatality rate decreased by 50% compared to a 53% reduction for serious injuries and a 57% reduction for slight injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Casualty rates of pedestrian casualties by severity per billion miles walked, GB: 2004 to 2024\n\n\nYear\nKilled\nSerious\nSlight\nAll\n\n\n\n\n2004\n52\n775\n1879\n2706\n\n\n2005\n53\n747\n1832\n2632\n\n\n2006\n52\n696\n1633\n2381\n\n\n2007\n52\n713\n1680\n2445\n\n\n2008\n46\n676\n1567\n2288\n\n\n2009\n39\n601\n1439\n2079\n\n\n2010\n33\n605\n1493\n2131\n\n\n2011\n36\n611\n1451\n2098\n\n\n2012\n35\n631\n1415\n2080\n\n\n2013\n32\n557\n1328\n1917\n\n\n2014\n36\n580\n1403\n2020\n\n\n2015\n33\n548\n1343\n1923\n\n\n2016\n34\n498\n1278\n1811\n\n\n2017\n35\n477\n1241\n1752\n\n\n2018\n33\n477\n1104\n1614\n\n\n2019\n34\n470\n1093\n1598\n\n\n2020\n24\n293\n689\n1006\n\n\n2021\n26\n351\n805\n1182\n\n\n2022\n26\n393\n874\n1292\n\n\n2023\n26\n393\n831\n1250\n\n\n2024\n26\n366\n813\n1205\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Sex and age comparisons\nBetween 2020 and 2024, 57% of pedestrian casualties were male and 43% female.\nThere are 1.3 times more male than female pedestrian casualties overall. This compares to 1.6 more for 30-39, 1.8 more for 0-11and 0.9 more for 70+ - the only age group in which female casualties outnumber males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Which vehicles are involved in collisions with pedestrians?\nBetween 2020 and 2024, most pedestrian fatalities occurred in 1 vehicle collisions involving a car (1047).\nHowever, the highest proportion of casualties from single vehicle collisions involve 1 heavy goods vehicle (16.4%). The second highest proportion (10.5%) occurred in collisions when 3 or more other vehicles involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Pedestrian casualties in reported road collisions by severity showing other vehicles involved GB: 2020 to 2024\n\n\nVehicles\nFatalities\nSerious injuries\nSlight injuries\nAll casualties\n% Fatalities\n\n\n\n\n1 pedal cycle\n9\n738\n1430\n2177\n0.4\n\n\n1 motorcycle\n51\n1167\n2447\n3665\n1.4\n\n\n1 car\n1047\n19241\n44370\n64658\n1.6\n\n\n1 bus or coach\n96\n924\n1809\n2829\n3.4\n\n\n1 light goods vehicle\n165\n1936\n4177\n6278\n2.6\n\n\n1 heavy goods vehicle\n176\n394\n502\n1072\n16.4\n\n\n1 other vehicle\n41\n740\n1803\n2584\n1.6\n\n\n2 vehicles involved\n201\n1432\n3151\n4784\n4.2\n\n\n3 or more other vehicles involved\n118\n422\n580\n1120\n10.5\n\n\nTotal\n1904\n26994\n60269\n89167\n2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Time of day of collisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weekday peak time for pedestrian KSIs is from 3pm to 6pm. By contrast, the peak is from 4pm to 7pm at weekends.\n\n\n8. What type of road?\nChart 5 shows that between 2020 and 2024, 66% of pedestrian fatalities occurred on urban roads compared to 87% of all pedestrian casualties. 5% of pedestrian fatalities occurred on motorways. This would be people outside their vehicles whether they are moving at the time or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this report, urban roads are defined as those within an area of population of 10,000 or more in England and Wales or more than 3,000 in Scotland - roads outside of these areas are classified as rural https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/road-length-statistics-information/road-lengths-in-great-britain-statistics-notes-and-definitions.\n\n\n9. Vehicle movement on the road\nA majority of pedestrian fatalities( 62 %) occur not at junction or within 20 metres compared to 50 % of serious injuries (adjusted). However, 30 % of fatalities occur at a junction compared to 38 % of serious injuries (adjusted).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Percentage of pedestrian KSI casualties by severity and junction detail where the collision occurred, GB: 2020 to 2024\n\n\nJunction\nFatalities\nSerious\nSlight\nAll casualties\n\n\n\n\nNot at junction or within 20 metres\n61.5%\n49.8%\n48.7%\n49.3%\n\n\nT or staggered junction\n23.3%\n30.2%\n30%\n29.9%\n\n\nCrossroads\n7.1%\n8.2%\n7.5%\n7.7%\n\n\n19\n5.6%\n7.1%\n7.6%\n7.4%\n\n\nUsing private drive or entrance\n1.6%\n1.8%\n2.1%\n2%\n\n\nData missing or out of range\n0.2%\n0.9%\n2.3%\n1.8%\n\n\nJunction with more than four arms (not roundabout)\n0.7%\n2%\n1.7%\n1.8%\n\n\nunknown (self reported)\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections 10 not reproducible as data is not public and sections 11 and 14 are simply explanatory text.\nThis document is also useful for understanding the methodology behind the categories https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68373a464115cfe5bfaa2cd4/STATS20_2024_specification.pdf"
